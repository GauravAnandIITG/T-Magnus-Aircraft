# ✈️ Flettner Aircraft (T-Magnus Plane)

A prototype rotor airplane developed in collaboration with **Kalam Labs, Lucknow**.  
This project explores the concept of using the **Magnus Effect** for lift generation through a rotating cylinder (**Flettner rotor**) instead of conventional wings.

## 📌 Overview

The **Flettner Aircraft (T-Magnus Plane)** was ideated as part of the **Techmaker Program**, aiming to create engaging and educational aerospace prototypes compatible with **Kalam Labs' in-house KL Microcontroller**.

## ❓ What is a Flettner Aircraft?

A **Flettner airplane** is a type of rotor aircraft that uses a **Flettner rotor** for lift.

- The rotor is a **spinning cylinder** with circular end plates.  
- As the aircraft moves forward, the **Magnus Effect** generates lift.

## 🌪️ What is the Magnus Effect?

The **Magnus Effect** occurs when a spinning object moves through a fluid (air or liquid).

- A **lift force** acts perpendicular to the direction of motion.  
- The force depends on the **speed and direction of rotation**.  
- Commonly observed in **sports balls, turbines, and experimental aircraft**.

## 🛠️ Project Timeline & Iterations

### 📌 Ideation
- **September 2024**: Concept proposed to **Kalam Labs** for demonstration using their **KL Microcontroller**.  
- Confirmed by **Kalam Labs Co-Founders** for their showcase program.  

---

### 🔧 Iteration 1
**Components:**
- Propeller motor: `Sunsky 2200 KV`  
- Rotor motor: `Emax 935 KV`  
- Gear mechanism replaced with pulley-belt system  

**Issue:**  
- Rotor shaft airflow blocked by propeller → ❌ No lift generated  

---

### 🔧 Iteration 2
**Changes:**
- Propeller repositioned **below rotor axis**  

**Issue:**  
- Torque instability during takeoff → ❌ Uncontrollable spinning & crash  

**Fix:**  
- Extended vertical rod + lowered battery → ✅ Better center of gravity  

**Outcome:**  
- Improved stability, but **lift < weight**  

---

### 🔧 Iteration 3
**Changes:**
- Integrated with **KL Microcontroller**  
- Reduced weight: **400g → 85g**  

**Outcome:**  
- More efficient system, but still **insufficient lift for flight**

## 🎤 Showcase

- 📅 **October 25, 2024**  
- Presented at the **Techmaker Program Showcase** organized by **Kalam Labs**  
- Demonstrated **concept + iterations** to judges and attendees
