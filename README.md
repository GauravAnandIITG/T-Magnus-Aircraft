Overview

The Flettner Aircraft (T-Magnus Plane) is a prototype rotor airplane developed in collaboration with Kalam Labs, Lucknow.
It explores the concept of using the Magnus Effect for lift generation through a rotating cylinder (Flettner rotor) instead of conventional wings.

This project was ideated as part of the Techmaker Program, aiming to create engaging and educational aerospace prototypes compatible with Kalam Labs' in-house KL Microcontroller.

What is a Flettner Aircraft?

A Flettner airplane is a type of rotor aircraft that uses a Flettner rotor for lift.

The rotor is a spinning cylinder with circular end plates.

As the aircraft moves forward, the Magnus Effect generates lift.

What is the Magnus Effect?

The Magnus Effect occurs when a spinning object moves through a fluid (air or liquid).

A lift force acts perpendicular to the direction of motion.

The force depends on the speed and direction of rotation.

This principle is widely observed in sports balls, turbines, and experimental aircraft.

Project Timeline & Iterations
ðŸ“Œ Ideation

September 2024: Concept proposed to Kalam Labs for demonstration using their KL Microcontroller.

Confirmed by Kalam Labs Co-Founders for their showcase program.

ðŸ”§ Iteration 1

Components:

Propeller motor: Sunsky 2200 KV

Rotor motor: Emax 935 KV

Gear mechanism replaced with pulley-belt system.

Issue: Rotor shaft airflow blocked by propeller â†’ No lift generated.

ðŸ”§ Iteration 2

Propeller repositioned below rotor axis.

Issue: Torque instability during takeoff â†’ uncontrollable spinning and crash.

Fix: Extended vertical rod + lowered battery â†’ better center of gravity.

Outcome: Improved stability, but lift < weight.

ðŸ”§ Iteration 3

Integrated with KL Microcontroller.

Reduced weight from 400g â†’ 85g.

Outcome: More efficient, but still insufficient lift for flight.

Showcase

ðŸ“… October 25, 2024

Presented at the Techmaker Program Showcase organized by Kalam Labs.

Demonstrated concept and iterations to judges and attendees.
